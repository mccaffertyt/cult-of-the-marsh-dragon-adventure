Cult of the Marsh Dragon - Adventure on the Island of Adventure

Cult of the Marsh Dragon is an adventure set in my sandbox module The Island Adventure. (See also under-hilltop-adventure, murder-in-riverbend-adventure and jail-break-adventure)

It is a DnD5e adventure with no levels set for the NPCs, so the DM can determine as they see fit what challenge they want to set the party.

A farm has been attacked near the village of Riverside. The baron has heard it was attacked by Lizardmen from the Great Marsh. Sir Gregory the Keep Castilian hires the
adventures to investigate what is going on.

The island is a place for adventure based on my own D&D campaign centered around the D&D module series B - The search for adventure.

The adventure portraits, tokens, text and maps have been produced by Tom McCafferty using Paint Dot Net, Dungeondraft and Unreal Engine which allow commercial use of content created with them.

Some references have been made to the Foundry VTT DnD5e Game System but no art work or tokens is
included. These artwork file references have been included in the packaging of the 
adventure to indicate the monsters and items the DM should use. This art work is provided by Forgotten
Adventures and the FA -  Fan-Content License seems to indicate that it is okay to deploy
references to these tokens.
