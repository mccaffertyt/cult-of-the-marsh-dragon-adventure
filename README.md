Under Hilltop - Adventure on the Island of Adventure

Under Hilltop is an adventure set in my Island of Adventure: based around Keep on the Borderland.
It is a DnD5e adventure with no levels set for the NPCs, so the DM can determine as they see fit what challenges they want to set the party.
The island is a place for adventure based on my own D&D campaign centered around the D&D module series B - The search for adventure.
The the portraits, tokens, text and maps have been produced by Tom McCafferty using Paint Dot Net and Dungeondraft
