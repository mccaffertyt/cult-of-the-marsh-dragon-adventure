Under Hilltop - Adventure on the Island of Adventure

Under Hilltop is an adventure set in my sandbox module The Island Adventure.

It is a DnD5e adventure with no levels set for the NPCs, so the DM can determine as they see fit what challenge they want to set the party.

The outlaws have been raiding caravans along the road between Two Waters and The Keep.

Cartwright the grocer is the latest victim of their raids and has organised a group of merchants to pay for the hire of adventurers 
to bring them to justice and recover their goods.

The island is a place for adventure based on my own D&D campaign centered around the D&D module series B - The search for adventure.

The adventure portraits, tokens, text and maps have been produced by Tom McCafferty using Paint Dot Net and Dungeondraft

Some Foundry VTT DnD5e Game System art work and tokens is included. This artwork has been included in the packaging of the adventure to 
indicate the monsters and items the DM should use. This art work is provided by Fantasy Art and the FA -Â  Fan-Content License seems to 
indicate that it is okay to deploy these tokens in a non-commercial way, which this adventure is intended to be.
